Twitter Bot using Tweepy
Welcome to the Twitter Bot using Tweepy project! This project provides a framework for creating and deploying a custom Twitter bot using the Tweepy library, a Python wrapper for the Twitter API. Whether you want to automate posting tweets, interact with followers, or analyze Twitter data, this project offers a versatile solution for building your own Twitter bot.

The Twitter Bot supports various functionalities, including tweeting, retweeting, liking tweets, following users, and even replying to mentions. It is designed to be easy to set up and customize, allowing you to tailor the bot's behavior to suit your specific needs.

To get started, ensure you have a Twitter Developer account and obtain API credentials (consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret). Clone the repository and update the configuration file with your API credentials and other settings. You can then use the provided scripts to implement the desired bot actions, such as posting tweets or responding to mentions.

The Twitter Bot also includes features for scheduling tweets, filtering content based on keywords or hashtags, and analyzing engagement metrics. It is a powerful tool for automating your Twitter presence and engaging with your audience effectively.

Contributions are welcome! Whether you're interested in adding new features, optimizing performance, or fixing bugs, we encourage you to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. This project is licensed under the MIT License, ensuring it is free to use and modify.
